# GeeksforGeeks 160-Day DSA Challenge

This repository contains my daily progress and solutions in Java for the GFG 160-Day DSA Challenge.

## ðŸ“… Day 1:
- âœ… Second Largest Number in Array
- âœ… Move Zero At Last
- âœ… Reverse Array

## ðŸ“… Day 2:
- âœ… Rotate Array
- âœ… Next Permutation

## ðŸ“… Day 3:

- âœ… 1.Majority Element II

 Question -You are given an array of integer arr[] where each number represents a vote to a candidate. Return the candidates that have votes greater than one-third of the total votes, If there's not a majority vote, return an empty array. 

Note: The answer should be returned in an increasing format.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
Output: [5, 6]
Explanation: 5 and 6 occur more n/3 times.



- âœ… 2.Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Multiple Transaction Allowed

  Question - The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock i at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.

Note: A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.

Examples:

Input: prices[] = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]
Output: 865
Explanation: Buy the stock on day 0 and sell it on day 3 => 310 â€“ 100 = 210. Buy the stock on day 4 and sell it on day 6 => 695 â€“ 40 = 655. Maximum Profit = 210 + 655 = 865.
