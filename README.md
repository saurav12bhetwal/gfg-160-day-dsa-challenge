## ðŸ“… Day 3:

- âœ… 1.Majority Element II

 Question -You are given an array of integer arr[] where each number represents a vote to a candidate. Return the candidates that have votes greater than one-third of the total votes, If there's not a majority vote, return an empty array. 

Note: The answer should be returned in an increasing format.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
Output: [5, 6]

- âœ… 2.Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Multiple Transaction Allowed

  Question - The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock i at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.

Note: A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.

Examples:

Input: prices[] = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]
Output: 865
Explanation: Buy the stock on day 0 and sell it on day 3 => 310 â€“ 100 = 210. Buy the stock on day 4 and sell it on day 6 => 695 â€“ 40 = 655. Maximum Profit = 210 + 655 = 865.


## ðŸ“… Day 4:

- âœ… 1.Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max one Transaction Allowed
Question - Given an array prices[] of length n, representing the prices of the stocks on different days. The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell. If it is not possible to make a profit then return 0.

Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.

Examples:

Input: prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can buy the stock on day 2 at price = 1 and sell it on day 5 at price = 9. Hence, the profit is 8.
